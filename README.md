# Data Scientist with Python

**In this Repository, I will be tackling the carrer track for Data Scientist with Python provided by DataCamp. I will be using jupyter notebook to keep track of every excersice and project that I need to complete in order to recerived credit for each course. 

During this courses I will learn how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, you'll get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. You'll then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP). Start this track, grow your Python skills, and begin your journey to becoming a confident data scientist.

###What is Python?

**'Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.'
